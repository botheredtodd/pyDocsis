I made documentation!
===================================

**pyDocsis** is a library I made because I couldn't find an easy way to work with Docsis 3.1 files in code.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
